# INCORPO.RO Cryptocurrency Tokenomics Analysis: Project Scope

## Project Overview

This project aims to leverage advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically embedding models, to analyze cryptocurrency whitepapers and identify key factors that contribute to successful tokenomics. By examining the correlation between whitepaper content and cryptocurrency performance, we seek to provide data-driven insights into what makes the most popular coins "tick" in the crypto market.

## Objectives

1. Develop a robust methodology for analyzing cryptocurrency whitepapers using embedding models.
2. Identify key linguistic and semantic features in whitepapers that correlate with cryptocurrency success.
3. Create a predictive model to assess the potential success of new cryptocurrencies based on their whitepaper content.
4. Provide actionable insights for cryptocurrency developers, investors, and researchers.

## Methodology

1. Data Collection:
   - Gather a comprehensive dataset of cryptocurrency whitepapers, including both successful and less successful projects.
   - Collect corresponding performance metrics (e.g., market capitalization, trading volume, price stability) for each cryptocurrency.

2. Text Processing:
   - Develop a pipeline to process LaTeX files and convert them into a format suitable for NLP analysis.
   - Implement preprocessing steps to handle technical jargon, mathematical notations, and crypto-specific terminology.

3. Embedding Analysis:
   - Utilize state-of-the-art embedding models (e.g., OpenAI, BGE) to generate high-dimensional representations of whitepaper content.
   - Apply dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA, t-SNE) to visualize and initially analyze the embedding space.

4. Feature Extraction:
   - Employ advanced techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) or LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to identify important features within the embeddings.
   - Analyze attention mechanisms in transformer-based models to understand which parts of the text are most influential.

5. Correlation Analysis:
   - Investigate the relationship between extracted features and cryptocurrency performance metrics.
   - Identify patterns and trends that distinguish successful projects from less successful ones.

6. Model Development:
   - Create a predictive model that assesses the potential success of a cryptocurrency based on its whitepaper content.
   - Validate the model using cross-validation techniques and out-of-sample testing.

7. Interpretation and Insights:
   - Translate technical findings into actionable insights for stakeholders.
   - Develop visualizations and summaries to effectively communicate results.

## Expected Outcomes

1. A comprehensive report detailing the linguistic and semantic features that correlate with successful cryptocurrency tokenomics.
2. A predictive model capable of assessing the potential success of new cryptocurrency projects based on whitepaper analysis.
3. A set of best practices and recommendations for writing effective cryptocurrency whitepapers.
4. Visualizations and interactive tools to explore the relationship between whitepaper content and crypto success.

## Scope Limitations

- The analysis is primarily based on whitepaper content and does not account for external factors such as market conditions, regulatory environment, or team execution. While some "hints" of team cohesion as well as competence is deducted from the quality of the whitepaper, a large amount of variability is expected.
- The project focuses on public information and does not include analysis of private or confidential documents.
- While the project aims to provide insights, it should not be considered as financial advice or a guarantee of cryptocurrency success.

## Stakeholders

- Cryptocurrency developers and project teams
- Investors and venture capitalists in the crypto space
- Blockchain researchers and academics
- Cryptocurrency exchanges and listing platforms

## Timeline and Milestones

[To be determined based on project resources and priorities]

## Ethical Considerations

- Ensure that the analysis does not inadvertently reveal any confidential information.
- Maintain transparency about the limitations and potential biases in the analysis.
- Consider the potential impact of the findings on the cryptocurrency market and individual projects.

This project scope is subject to refinement and may evolve as the project progresses and new insights emerge.
